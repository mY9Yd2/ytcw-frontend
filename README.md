# A simple Angular frontend for my ytcw backend project

Link: [ytcw](https://github.com/mY9Yd2/ytcw)

This project is managed with pnpm, so please make sure you have it installed.

## Contribution

I’m primarily a backend developer and have much less experience with Angular.
I don’t currently have enough time to learn Angular in depth, so any help, improvements, or contributions are very welcome!
If you’d like to improve the frontend, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
